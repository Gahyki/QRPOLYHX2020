# QRPOLYHX2020

===
## Hackathon Project
Centered around the theme "Smart City"

This project aims at creating an application for students regarding the exchange of information through QR codes. Each user (student) will have a QR code assigned to them with school features stored in the code such as their student email, ID and picture. Furthermore, there will be a customisation feature that will allow students to input their own information to share through QR scans on top of school utilities.
